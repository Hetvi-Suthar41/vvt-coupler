        <h1>Shipping and Delivery Policy</h1>

        <h3>1. Order Processing and Delivery Time</h3>
        <p>Orders are typically processed within 1–2 business days.<br>
        Delivery times vary based on your location and the product size. Estimated timelines are between 8–14 business days.<br>
        Delays may occur due to unforeseen circumstances or force majeure events.</p>

        <h3>2. Shipping Costs</h3>
        <p>Shipping costs are calculated based on the weight, dimensions, and destination of your order. You can view the cost at checkout. Additional charges may apply for oversized or heavy shipments.</p>

        <h3>3. Delivery Location and Access</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for providing an accurate and accessible delivery address.<br>
        You must ensure that the delivery location has the necessary access for the delivery vehicle. You are liable for any additional costs incurred due to inaccessible locations.</p>

        <h3>4. Offloading Responsibility</h3>
        <p>For heavy or bulky materials, offloading is your responsibility. You must arrange for the necessary labor or equipment (e.g., forklift) to offload the goods from the delivery vehicle.<br>
        Our delivery partners are not obligated to assist with offloading.</p>

        <h3>5. Risk of Loss</h3>
        <p>The risk of loss and title for items pass to you upon delivery. You are responsible for inspecting the goods for any damage or defects at the time of delivery.</p>

        <h3>6. Tracking</h3>
        <p>You will receive tracking information via email or SMS once your order has been dispatched.</p>
