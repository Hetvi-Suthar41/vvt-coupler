        <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>

        <h3>1. Order Cancellation</h3>
        <p><strong>Pre-Dispatch Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel an order for a full refund at any point before it is dispatched for delivery.<br>
        <strong>Post-Dispatch Cancellation:</strong> Due to the logistics involved with construction materials, cancellations are not possible once the order has been dispatched.</p>

        <h3>2. Returns and Refunds</h3>
        <p><strong>Inspection on Delivery:</strong> For items like rebar couplers, you must inspect the products at the time of delivery. Do not accept a damaged or incorrect shipment. Returns or replacements for such issues must be initiated on the spot.</p>
        <p><strong>Return Window (Smaller Items):</strong> For smaller construction materials, returns are accepted within 2 days of delivery, provided the items are unused, in their original packaging, and in returnable condition.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Returnable Items:</strong> Custom-made products, cut-to-size materials, or items damaged during installation are not eligible for return.</p>
        <p><strong>Damaged/Defective Items:</strong> If you receive a defective or incorrect item, you must notify our customer service within 2 days with photographic evidence to arrange for a replacement or refund.</p>
        <p><strong>Refund Processing:</strong> Refunds for eligible returns will be processed within 9â€“15 business days after the product is inspected and approved. The refund will be credited to the original payment method.</p>

        <h3>3. Refund Exclusions</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to deduct payment gateway fees and shipping charges for refunds initiated due to customer reasons, where applicable.</p>
